\section{Acknowledgement}
At the end of EE464- Static Power Conversion II course, we feel that we have learned a lot about Power Electronics. Especially this project helped us solidify our knowledge as it covers a broad range of topics such as Compensator Design, Transient Analysis of Converter Circuits -both analytically and experimentally- PCB Design and Magnetic Design in addition to Steady State Analysis of Converter Circuits. We want to express our gratitude to Prof. Keysan for guiding us for two semesters through some extensive material and also supporting us to be prepared for our life after graduation. Also, we want to thank the course assistants for their support.
