\section{Conclusion}
\par In this report, our goal of designing a DC-DC converter as the Hardware Project of EE464 course is evaluated in detail. First, a topology for this task -Flyback Converter in our case- is chosen. Then, the main design choices and their theoretical background for Flyback Converter are discussed. After calculations, the findings are supported and verified with computer simulations. According to the obtained data, real components are chosen as a step to realize the circuit.
